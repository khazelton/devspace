Imagine a future in which humans succeed in colonizing other planetary
systems. It is then easy to imagine an intergalactic human population
numbering something huge beyond imagining – 1040, say – all, one
hopes, leading fulfilling lives. On a purely utilitarian reckoning, the net
happiness in such a future so astronomically outweighs that of the global
population today that we should stop at nothing to bring it about.
Imagine, on the other hand, that we develop a superintelligent AI so superior
to us that it decides humankind to be irrelevant or a hindrance – and wipes us
out. Total human happiness: zero. In that case, no goal is more important than
averting this “alignment problem”, in which our interests do not fit with those
of the machine. World poverty, climate change, pandemic disease – all are
relatively trivial in comparison.
These are not the musings of a wild millenarian cult, but are among the
scenarios envisaged, and the positions espoused, by the most powerful and
well-resourced coterie of influencers on the planet: tech billionaires such as the
X and Tesla owner Elon Musk, the PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Sam Altman of
OpenAI, the software entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, and those they fund.
Their ethos pervades Silicon Valley: they advise governments (especially
Donald Trump’s, but we can number Boris Johnson’s former strategist Dominic
Cummings in their ranks), hold academic positions at Oxford and Harvard, and
lead influential think tanks.
Yet there are few scientific experts among them. As the science writer Adam
Becker explains in More Everything Forever, their visions depend largely on
bogus philosophy coupled to technologies, such as nanorobots the size of
viruses, that not only do not exist, but are not on any serious scientist’s
research agenda. Occasionally, a real expert such as Stephen Hawking or the
Nobel laureate in physics Geoffrey Hinton might stray beyond their expertise to
make a remark that seems to support such fantasies – witness Hawking saying
in 2014 that AI “could spell the end of the human race” – generally to a rapt
response from a credulous press, oblivious or wilfully blind to the sea of eyerolling
from those better informed.
Every now and then, though, the mask falls – and the often racist, supremacist,
anti-democratic or eugenicist leanings of this community are exposed. Take the
comment made in 1996 by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, of the Future of
Humanity Institute in Oxford, that “it is probable that black people have a
lower average IQ than mankind in general”. (He has since apologized, without
admitting that the claim has no scientific basis. “It’s not my area of expertise”,
he says, “so I don’t really know.”) Or take the contention by the AI safety
consultant Nick Beckstead in 2013 that “it now seems more plausible to me that
saving a life in a rich country is substantially more important than saving a life
in a poor country”. And here is Andreessen, whose vision Becker calls
“permanent galactic fascism”, in full Nietzschean mode: “Beauty exists only in
struggle … We believe in greatness … ambition, aggression, persistence,
relentlessness – strength”. Thiel makes no secret of his contempt for
democratic institutions; his enthusiasm for space colonization is based in part
on the understanding that it would allow a cohort of humanity to be free of
them. As for Musk, who has condemned empathy as “the fundamental
weakness of western civilization”, his recent “Roman salute” spoke louder than
any words.
Becker explains how we got to this perilous juncture. One key driver, he
believes, is the effective altruism (EA) movement, which began with the
argument that, if we truly believe in helping the needy, our goal should be to
make a large amount of money by whatever means necessary, then channel it
into charitable causes. Before he was jailed for fraud, the entrepreneur and EA
advocate Sam Bankman-Fried showed that he took the first part of that task
seriously, while showing less sign of getting round to the second. Gradually, the
emphasis of EA shifted from the plight of people who actually exist to those
who could potentially exist in what Becker calls “our glorious-yet-improbable
science-fictional future” – and whose hypothetical numbers so exceed our own
that no here-and-now problem can compete.
Once this ideal has been established, anything goes. “If we had a trillion
humans”, Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has fantasized, “we would have a
thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts.” And if, by this logic, democracy
stands in the way, then it is time to trash democracy. Becker writes:
Theirs is an “ideology of technological salvation” in which all problems are
“The credence that tech billionaires give to these science-fictional
futuresvalidates their pursuit of more – to portray the growth of their
business as a moral imperative, to reduce the complex problems of
the world to simple questions of technology, to justify nearly any
action they might want to take – all in the name of saving humanity
from a threat that doesn’t exist, aiming at a utopia that will never
come.”
problems about technology. And that, needless to say, is great news if you’re a
tech entrepreneur – and is catnip to credulous investors unable to distinguish
science from its superficial trappings.
And superficial they certainly are. With admirable clarity and patience, Becker
dismantles the fantasies one by one: the AI apocalypse that obscures the real
and immediate problems the algorithms are causing, concerning bias,
misinformation and energy consumption; the absurd notion of “mind
uploading” and the transcendental Singularity that will grant us immortality in
a digital nirvana (“All of humanity, running on a computer, until the end of
time”); the pipe dream of creating a civilization of billions on airless, frigid,
radiation-strafed Mars. It must have been dispiriting to have to wade through
so much junk science and trite philosophy. Yet it is not, Becker rightly cautions,
that these people are stupid. In many cases, they are extremely articulate, well
read and sharp. The problem is that a reflexive contrarianism, coupled with
worldly success, has eroded their ability to think and evaluate evidence to the
point where they believe all real experts are idiots, conventional wisdom is
always wrong, and only they have the independence of thought to figure it all
out.
Such delusions can only really be understood as a form of theology: these tech
gurus tend to be deeply antagonistic to religion (though, tellingly, some come
from fundamentalist Christian backgrounds, and Thiel, for example, has
assimilated what he refers to as a “heterodox Christianity” into his thinking)
because they have their own stories of heaven (techno utopia) and hell
(stagnation, caused by socialism and corruption by the “woke mind virus”).
We, in our turn, make them the new pontiffs, hailing them as geniuses as they
preach to true believers about the approaching technological rapture or day of
reckoning. Evidence of a messiah complex pervades their discourse: “I’m the
only one who can make the effort … I am a hero”, says the computer scientist
and influential AI commentator Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose new book, If
Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, is due out this autumn. Musk, we now know,
is systematically spreading his allegedly superior genes by impregnating an
undisclosed number of women with a “legion” of children running well into
double figures.
Writing More Everything Forever took guts: as Becker surely knows, he is
critiquing a movement fuelled by unfathomable reserves of anger, resolve and
anomie, not to mention wealth and power. He argues that the only reason we
are forced to confront these fantasies is that they come from people who can
buy public and political influence. But, as the historian Quinn Slobodian
illustrates in his new book, Hayek’s Bastards, the technofascist movement is
part of a wider landscape.
Slobodian challenges the idea that the populist alt-right – exemplified by the
former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in
Germany – represents a break from the more conventional neoliberalist
capitalism of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. On the contrary, he says,
the current obsession of the far right with immigration and race, and its
determination to dismantle democratic norms, have always been themes for
champions of the free market: “Many contemporary iterations of the Far Right
emerged within neoliberalism, not in opposition to it.”
The last common ancestor of these lineages, as biologists might put it, was
Thatcher’s idol, the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek (1899–1992),
author of an influential defence of capitalism, The Road to Serfdom (1944).
That book was a response to totalitarianism, especially to Soviet-style
centralized planning. So, while Hayek’s belief in the optimizing agency of
unfettered free markets looks naive today, it should be appraised in the light of
what it was ranged against. The thinking of the Austrian school of economics,
championed by Hayek and his mentor Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973), was
central to the Chicago school spearheaded by Milton Friedman (1912–2006),
who advised Reagan and Thatcher and won an “economics Nobel” (the
Sveriges Riksbank prize) for work that became a part of mainstream “rational
expectations” theory, in which agents are assumed to make rational, unbiased
decisions about the future based on all available evidence – a situation more
attractive because it is mathematically tractable than because it describes
reality.
For Slobodian, Hayek’s “bastards” are those who seized these ideas and turned
them into a pseudoscientific libertarianism mired in racism, supremacism,
eugenics and disdain for taxation, regulation and indeed democracy. They
include Charles Murray, the F. A. Hayek Chair Emeritus at the right-wing
American Enterprise Institute, who argued in The Bell Curve (1994) that Black
people have lower average intelligence than whites; the American libertarian
economist Murray Rothbard (1926–95), associated with the Austrian school,
who opposed the civil rights movement; and Rothbard’s protégé Hans-
Hermann Hoppe – the author of, among other things, Democracy: The god that
failed (2001) – to whom Slobodian attributes a “rhetoric of violent suppression
of difference and program of racialized secession [that] has been embraced by
the alt-right”.
As the author argues, such figures didn’t so much corrupt Hayek’s mainstream
neoliberalism as pursue it to its natural conclusion. A problem for advocates of
wholly free markets is that they seem to demand free movement of people, for
how else can corporations acquire the best employees? But Hayek’s view, and
Mises’s too, was that human nature was just too intolerant of cultural
differences to make unfettered immigration viable – a position Hayek
supported with an increasingly biologized version of his economic thought.
This Hayekian stance has been echoed by the British-born financial journalist
Peter Brimelow, who argues that “ethnic and cultural coherence” is a
precondition for the efficiency of free markets.
Brimelow, who founded the anti-immigration website VDARE, exemplifies how
such rhetoric can easily move from “immigration harms the market” to “not all
cultures and races are equally economically productive anyway”. After all,
hadn’t Mises himself written that “it may be assumed that races do differ in
intelligence and will power, and that, this being so, they are very unequal in
their ability to form society”? In his columns for the Financial Post, Brimelow
has floated the “provocative” idea that some non-white groups are indeed
innately intellectually inferior; in his book Alien Nation (1995), he called
affirmative action programmes “government-mandated discrimination against
white Americans”.
Charles Murray and others euphemize such ideas about racial intellectual
differences being inscribed in genetics as “human diversity”: in this view, not
only are humans not all equal in capacities, but these differences are
systematic between specific populations. Slobodian unveils the deep
connections between free-market libertarians and the network of “race
scientists” who have long misrepresented and misunderstood scientific
research to argue for fixed and immutable differences in ability and
intelligence, not just between races, but also between sexes and classes. (To be
clear: the science implies nothing of the sort.) At its darkest, this faction draws
on dystopian fantasies in which western civilization is overwhelmed by the
mass immigration of non-whites, as depicted in the French writer Jean
Raspail’s novel The Camp of the Saints (1974). Allegedly an inspiration to
Bannon, Raspail’s book foreshadowed the Great Replacement theory of the altright,
according to which white populations are being steadily outnumbered by
subaltern immigrants, with the collusion of left-wing governments. This
directly feeds into Trump’s rhetoric about pet-eating Haitian immigrants in
Ohio and Mexicans who are all drug dealers and rapists.
Here, too, we can find the origins of the Silicon Valley obsession with declining
birth rates, and of the pronatalist movement, which implores (the right kind
of ) people to have as many children as possible. Here is the justification for the
pseudoscientific genetic screening of IVF embryos for high intelligence and the
enthusiasm for other forms of eugenics among populists in the US and Europe.
All this lays false claim to the authority of science, freighted with the
apocalypticism described by Becker.
While Hayek favoured converting the intellectual elites to his views, his
“bastards”, argues Slobodian, have pushed a different tactic: as Rothbard put
it, rousing “the masses of people against the elites that are looting them … and
oppressing them”. Advising the hard-right Republican presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan in 1995, Rothbard wrote, “This is a revolution of white Euromales
and Pat needs to focus on their grievances and concerns”. Two decades
later, following Trump’s first victory, Jeff Deist, a former president of the Mises
Institute, argued that the job for libertarians was “to turn the nation’s
contempt for politicians into contempt for politics itself”. Another nine years
on, the fruits of all this thinking are plain to see.
Such alt-right tropes are certainly a bastardization of Hayek and the Austrian
school. But Slobodian goes on to show how some of Hayek’s core ideas have
provided inspiration for several far-right leaders today, including the AfD’s
leader, Alice Weidel (a member of Germany’s Friedrich A. Hayek Society until
2021) and the AfD politician and climate-change denier Peter Boehringer (who
remains a member of the society today). This is not mere guilt by association,
for Hayek and Mises expressed views on the supremacy of the West, on
immigration, on social policy and on human biology that prefigure the more
extreme pronouncements regularly voiced by today’s alt-right.
Speaking in 1984 at the Heritage Foundation, a hard-right American think tank,
Hayek said, “the truth of morals is … that of the Christian West, which has
created morals in modern civilization”. He considered social justice “atavistic”,
an indulgence that a self-sustaining world population could ill afford. He
convened the meeting in 1947 that led to the formation of the Mont Pelerin
Society (MPS), a group of influential free marketeers within which “race
science” has long found a welcome home. Slobodian refers to a meeting in
Gstaad in 1972 that followed that of the MPS nearby, at which “most of those
presenting were MPS members. Each held forth on their own variation of why
equality was a destructive fantasy. Many appealed to genetics and race”.
Fourteen years later, the MPS’s leader, James Buchanan, spoke of “persons and
groups [pulled] toward behaviour … that is dictated by hard wired elements in
their nature”. Slobodian also documents the influence of the psychologist
Richard Lynn, a central figure in “race science”, on various members of the
MPS. Elsewhere, Llewellyn Rockwell, the director of the Mises Institute in
Alabama and a key figure in the intellectual foundations of the alt-right, has
argued that immigrants should not be able to gain citizenship or access public
services. He was chief of staff to the hard-right Congressman Ron Paul, whose
“investment” newsletter, which Rockwell edited, regularly expressed sympathy
for right-wing militias and antipathy to Black and gay people.
Time and again, we see how Becker’s critique of Silicon Valley’s
technofantasies and Slobodian’s historical survey of the economic roots of the
alt-right intersect. They are both clearly present, for example, in ultralibertarians
such as Thiel, who has close ties with the Trump administration,
and Andreessen, whose “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” contains a staunchly
Hayekian defence of free markets, claiming that “central economic planning …
drags everyone down”, and who places Hayek among his “patron saints”. Both
books cite the Silicon Valley influencer and software developer Curtis Yarvin,
who, Becker claims, is close to J. D. Vance, and who has argued for the
disenfranchisement of anyone with an IQ below 120 in South Africa. He has
also written that “there needs to be a fence between me and all populations of
wild hominids”.
As Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor recently argued, racialized economic
libertarianism and technological utopias are twin facets of an “end of times
fascism”, the adherents of which “dream of splintering governments and
carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the
sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries,
serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies” (see the Guardian,
April 13, 2025). And if this sounds like a dystopian conspiracy in its own right, it
is worth remembering that our current world until recently included a tech
baron at the heart of the US government who is currently trying to multiply his
offspring “to reach legion-level before the apocalypse”. “The governing
ideology of the far right in our age of escalating disasters has become a
monstrous, supremacist survivalism”, say Klein and Taylor. Trump is merely
their useful – if unpredictable – idiot. And while mainstream political pundits
solemnly intone that his administration is not the Fourth Reich, they seem
incapable of imagining that fascism can take forms very different from those of
the mid- twentieth century, while being potentially no less devastating.
