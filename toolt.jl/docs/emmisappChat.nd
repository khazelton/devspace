> /init is analyzing your codebase…

⏺ I'll analyze your codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file to help future instances of Claude Code work effectively in
  this repository.

⏺ Task(Analyze codebase structure)
  ⎿  Done (20 tool uses · 36.1k tokens · 4m 41.8s)

⏺ Now I'll check for any existing CLAUDE.md file in the root directory and examine key documentation files.

⏺ Read(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

⏺ Read(README.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/.cursorrules")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/.github/copilot-instructions.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

⏺ Let me check for any existing CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories to understand the pattern used in this workspace.

⏺ Read(toolt.jl/CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 83 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(i2Gpt-01/CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 52 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I'll create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for the root directory that covers the entire workspace.

⏺ Write(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 105 lines to CLAUDE.md
     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
     ## Workspace Overview
     This is a multi-project workspace focused on scientific computing, applied category theory, and web development. The
      workspace contains several independent projects, primarily using Julia for mathematical computing and Python for
     data analysis.
     ## Common Development Commands
     … +95 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for your workspace. The file provides:

  1. Common commands for Julia projects (activate, test, build docs), TypeScript/React projects (npm commands), and
  Python projects (pip/pipenv setup)
  2. High-level architecture covering:
    - The AlgebraicJulia ecosystem of category theory libraries
    - Scientific computing tools
    - Web applications
    - Educational resources
    - Key patterns across projects

  The file focuses on practical information that requires understanding multiple files and projects, avoiding repetitive
   details that can be easily discovered. It will help future Claude Code instances quickly understand the workspace
  structure and common development patterns.
